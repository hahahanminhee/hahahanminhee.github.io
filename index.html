		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- Sorry, the code is a little atrocious, but you'll get used to it. Working on it. Anyway, this is the first mini crossword I ever made. </p></details>
	</li>

	<li><a href="puzzle2.html" name="start">What I may tell you I'm allergic to</a> 8/8/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- I have many allergies, including fruits, notably stone fruits. I love peaches... too bad I can't eat them. </p></details>
	</li>
	
	<li><a href="puzzle3.html" name="start">Alma matters</a> 8/8/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- This one certainly favors those who 1) went to Rutgers and 2) know me. Sorry if that's not you! </p></details>
	</li>
	
	<li><a href="puzzle4.html" name="start">Hella vowels</a> 10/23/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- I thought it was sort of clever to have a sequence of vowels. I think "Y' could've made it's way in there, but it didn't quite help me out in this one. </p></details>
	
	</li>

	<li><a href="puzzle5.html" name="start">V is for...</a> 10/23/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- This is one where the shape (aka the filled in black squares) really dictated the theme. I was already thinking about Nov 5 and all related feelings... so just wanted to communicate the importance of voting in my own small way. </p></details>

	</li>

	<li><a href="puzzle6.html" name="start">Today's horoscope</a> 10/25/24 
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- At this point is when I felt truly like a crossword maker. I was thinking about how "water sign" could mean "rain" but also "Scorpio", my star sign, and so on. I figured all of the horoscope water signs were too long letter-wise for a mini, so I settled on "fire signs" instead. This is one in which the theme really got me excited and framed the puzzle. </p></details>

	<li><a href="puzzle7.html" name="start">Apple Sauce</a> 10/28/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- Another one where I tried to be matchy. I thought having a "criss" "cross" in a crisscross shape, and then "sin" and "aisle" made for a nice, churchly feel. </p></details>
	</li>

<!-- i'd love to add some type of notes thing to each listing so i can type in some fun stuff, like goofs, or how i came up with the puzzles or what i was inspired by-->
