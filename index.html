  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- Sorry, the code is a little atrocious, but you'll get used to it. Working on it. Anyway, this is the first mini crossword I ever made. There are some nods to things I enjoy, like BOBA. I thought BENTO and ROES kind of worked well together, like for a sushi bento vibe. ON AIR is a direct reference to my time as a music DJ. AW GEE gives Rick and Morty vibes. BAM is almost like BAMM, which was the acronym for the college dorm complex I RA'd at. </p></details>

		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- I have many allergies, including fruits, notably stone fruits. I love PEACHes... too bad I can't eat them. For anyone wondering why my gamer tag is usually "minheepeaches", this is the lore. </p></details>

	<li><a href="puzzle3.html" name="start">Alma matters</a> 8/8/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- This one certainly favors those who 1) went to Rutgers and 2) know me. Sorry if that's not you! </p></details>
	</li>
	
	<li><a href="puzzle4.html" name="start">Hella vowels</a> 10/23/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- I thought it was sort of clever to have a sequence of vowels. You could argue that "y" should have been in there, but that would've made my life much harder. </p></details>
	
	</li>

	<li><a href="puzzle5.html" name="start">V is for...</a> 10/23/24
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- This is one where the shape (aka the filled in black squares) really dictated the theme. I was already thinking about Nov 5 and all related feelings... so just wanted to communicate the importance of voting in my own small way. </p></details>

	</li>

	<li><a href="puzzle6.html" name="start">Today's horoscope</a> 10/25/24 
		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- At this point is when I felt truly like a crossword maker. I was thinking about how "water sign" could mean RAIN but also SCORPIO, my star sign, and so on. Aha! Too bad SCORPIO, CANCER, and PISCES are all too long (letter-wise) for a mini, so I settled for "fire signs". Please pause for a moment of triumph. </p></details>

		<details name = "reqs" style="display:inline-block">
  			<summary>min's notes</summary>
    <p>-- Another one where I tried to be all matchy matchy. I thought having a CRISS and CROSS in a crisscross shape, and then SIN and AISLE made for a nice, churchly puzzle. Idk, I felt really smart. </p></details>

<!-- i'd love to add some type of notes thing to each listing so i can type in some fun stuff, like goofs, or how i came up with the puzzles or what i was inspired by-->
